The code in UnlockGrapple, UnlockDoubleJump, and UnlockDash from line 41 to the end were created from scratch.
The code in teach is entirely from scratch besides Unity's default instantiation code.
The code in ouchiebox is entirely from scratch.
The code in mouseLook is taken directly from a seperate project I did before. 
In player.cs:
Lines 155-185 are written from scratch.
Lines 319 to 393 are written with the help of a Unity forums post, although it required very heavy modifications to work in our movement system.

Level.unity was my design.
I wrote EnemyAI.cs, RoomTrigger.cs, DestroyRobot.cs, Bird.cs, Finish.cs, PitTriiger.cs, SpawnStairs.cs, and the beginnings of UnlockGrapple, UnlockDoubleJump, UnlockDash.
