The code in teach is entirely from scratch besides Unity's default instantiation code.
The code in ouchiebox is entirely from scratch.
The code in mouseLook is taken directly from a seperate project I did before. 
In player.cs:
Lines 155-185 are written from scratch.
Lines 319 to 393 are written with the help of a Unity forums post, although it required very heavy modifications to work in our movement system.
