The code in UnlockGrapple, UnlockDoubleJump, and UnlockDash from line 41 to the end were created from scratch.
The code in teach is entirely from scratch besides Unity's default instantiation code.

In player.cs:
Lines 155-185 are written from scratch.
Lines 319 to 393 are written with the help of a Unity forums post, although it required very heavy modifications to work in our movement system.

Level.unity was my design.
I wrote EnemyAI.cs, RoomTrigger.cs, DestroyRobot.cs, Bird.cs, Finish.cs, PitTriiger.cs, SpawnStairs.cs, and the beginnings of UnlockGrapple, UnlockDoubleJump, UnlockDash.
I wrote the victory script from scratch and SettingsMenu was based on a youtube tutorial on video settings.
EnemyAI was based on a youtube tutorial on enemy AI and navmeshes.
Every other script I wrote was written from scratch.
I added animations and events regarding the enemies and bird.

I wrote the rest of player.cs, which was our character controller and physics script, from scratch, lines 0-155, 185-319, and 393-699
I added the third person camera code in MouseLook.cs, lines 38-45
I created Level.cs, using code from assignment 5 as a base and heavily modifying it to fit our game
I wrote a lot of Grapple.cs, most things aside from lines 58-64, basing the code on examples online
I made the PCGLevel.unity scene, which houses our time trial level
I fixed the UI's in game to scale with resolution, including UI in level.unity, mainmenu.unity, and PCGlevel.unity
I wrote MainMenuHandler.cs, used for handling button presses in menu, and Goal.cs, used for goal in PCGLevel
