In player.cs:

Level.unity was my design.
I wrote EnemyAI.cs, RoomTrigger.cs, DestroyRobot.cs, Bird.cs, Finish.cs, PitTriiger.cs, SpawnStairs.cs, and the beginnings of UnlockGrapple, UnlockDoubleJump, UnlockDash.
I wrote the victory script from scratch and SettingsMenu was based on a youtube tutorial on video settings.
EnemyAI was based on a youtube tutorial on enemy AI and navmeshes.
Every other script I wrote was written from scratch.
I added animations and events regarding the enemies and bird.
